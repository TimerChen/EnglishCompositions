# My View on pet raising #

For the public, pet raising is more than common. In a great quantity of family, a pet has become an essential member and taken part in their everyday life. Some people, however, frown on it, they maintain that the cons of pet raising outweighs the pros. From my own perspective, pet raising should not be totally denied, for both pros and cons exist.

We cannot ignore the benefits that raising a pet can bring to us. A pet can bring a tremendous amount of happiness to people, which makes their life bright, filled with joy and hope at the same time. Therefore, in many rest homes and hospital, animals are also kept as pets to treat people who need love badly and in deep despair.

Every cloud has a sliver lining. Consequently, the negative influence should also be taken into account. Some pets surly bring happiness to their owners, but sometimes they may also bother other people. For instance, dogs are too loyal that may scare or even hurt others by mistake, just for protecting their owners.

In summary, pet raising has both pros and cons, therefore we should figure out dialectically rather than give up eating for fear of choking. What we should do is take actions to reduce the negative influence of raising pets instead of avoiding it.
